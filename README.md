### Files

#### Extension.json 
is a configuration file for a MediaWiki extension. It contains information such as the extension's name, description, authors, and dependencies.
But currently the configuration in this project is also set in the `SemanticMediaWikiGraph.php` 

#### Package.json
is a configuration file that is used by the Node Package Manager (npm). It contains information about a Node.js project, such as the project's name, version, dependencies, and scripts.

The "dependencies" field in "package.json" specifies the packages that your project depends on, and the "scripts" field specifies scripts that can be run in the project.

#### Tsconfig.json
is a configuration file for the TypeScript compiler. It contains information on how the compiler should process the project's TypeScript files, such as include and exclude paths for the files to be compiled.

#### Webpack.config.js
is a configuration file for Webpack, a popular front-end build tool. It specifies how Webpack should process and bundle the project's files, such as which files should be included, which files should be excluded, and the output location for the final bundle.

Webpack is used to bundle and optimize assets, such as JavaScript, CSS, and images, for web applications. It allows you to write modular code and to use modern JavaScript features.

Webpack works by taking your source files, such as JavaScript (many) and CSS, and transforming them into a bundled output (usually a single JavaScript file). It can also optimize your assets by minifying and compressing them.
